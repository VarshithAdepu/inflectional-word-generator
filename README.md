# Inflectional Word Generator

This repository contains Python code for generating inflectional words for base words using paradigms defined in an XML file. The core functionality is implemented in the `generate_inflectional_words_for_dict` function that reads the XML file, extracts paradigm definitions, and generates inflectional forms for words based on those paradigms.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `xml.etree.ElementTree` library (standard Python library)

## Files

1. **`xml_tree.py`**: Contains the main function to generate inflectional words using paradigm definitions from an XML file.
2. **`finding_inflectional_words_in_corpus.py`**: This script contains a function to find the best matching paradigm from a given corpus of words.
3. **`README.md`**: Documentation for the repository.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
