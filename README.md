# Inflectional Word Generator

This repository contains Python code for generating inflectional words for base words using paradigms defined in an XML file. The core functionality is implemented in the `generate_inflectional_words_for_dict` function that reads the XML file, extracts paradigm definitions, and generates inflectional forms for words based on those paradigms.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `xml.etree.ElementTree` library (standard Python library)

## Files

1. **`xml_tree.py`**: Contains the main function to generate inflectional words using paradigm definitions from an XML file.
2. **`finding_inflectional_words_in_corpus.py`**: This script contains a function to find the best matching paradigm from a given corpus of words.
3. **`README.md`**: Documentation for the repository.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/inflectional-word-generator.git

## Navigate to the repository:

bash
Copy code
cd inflectional-word-generator
No additional installation is required as the code only uses Python’s built-in libraries.

Usage
xml_tree.py - generate_inflectional_words_for_dict
This function takes the path to an XML file and a dictionary of words with paradigms and generates inflectional forms for each base word. Here’s an example of how to use it:

python
Copy code
import xml_tree

# Define a dictionary of words with paradigms
words_with_paradigms = {
    "Pasala": {
        "rAw/a__n": [],
        "Gar/a__n": []
    }
}

# Path to the XML file that contains paradigm definitions
file_path = 'path_to_your_paradigm_file.xml'

# Call the function to generate inflectional words
results = xml_tree.generate_inflectional_words_for_dict(file_path, words_with_paradigms)

# Print the results
print(results)
finding_inflectional_words_in_corpus.py - find_best_matching_paradigm
This script allows you to find the best matching paradigm for a given corpus by comparing inflectional forms defined in the XML with words present in the corpus.

python
Copy code
import finding_inflectional_words_in_corpus

# Sample corpus
corpus = ["फसलों", "फसले"]

# Define a dictionary of words with paradigms
words_with_paradigms = {
    "Pasala": {
        "rAw/a__n": ["फसलों", "फसल", "फसलें"],
        "Gar/a__n": ["फसलों", "फसल"]
    }
}

# Call the function to find the best matching paradigms
best_paradigms = finding_inflectional_words_in_corpus.find_best_matching_paradigm(words_with_paradigms, corpus)

# Print the best matching paradigms
print(best_paradigms)
Example Input and Output
Input
python
Copy code
file_path = 'paradigms.xml'
words_with_paradigms = {
    "Pasala": {
        "rAw/a__n": ["फसलों", "फसल", "फसलें"],
        "Gar/a__n": ["फसलों", "फसल"]
    }
}
Output
python
Copy code
{
    "Pasala": {
        "rAw/a__n": ["फसलों", "फसले"],
        "Gar/a__n": ["फसलों", "फसले"]
    }
}
Error Handling
If the XML file cannot be parsed correctly, an error message will be displayed:

vbnet
Copy code
Failed to parse XML file: [error message]
If the <pardefs> element is not found in the XML file, the function will print:

php
Copy code
No <pardefs> element found.
